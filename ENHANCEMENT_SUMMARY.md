🎬 AI SAFETY MODELS POC - VIDEO DEMONSTRATION
============================================================

🎯 This demo showcases the four core AI Safety Models:
   • Abuse Language Detection
   • Escalation Pattern Recognition
   • Crisis Intervention
   • Content Filtering

⚡ Key Features:
   • Real-time processing (<100ms)
   • Age-appropriate filtering
   • Human-in-the-loop interventions
   • Bias mitigation and fairness

📋 SCENARIO 1: Child Safety - Profanity Detection
📝 Description: Demonstrates how the system protects children from inappropriate content
--------------------------------------------------
📥 INPUT:
   Text: 'fuck you'
   Age Group: child
   User ID: demo_user
   Session ID: 

📤 OUTPUT:
   Overall Risk: CRITICAL
   Intervention Level: emergency
   Max Score: 0.800
   Processing Time: 0.005s

📊 MODEL BREAKDOWN:
   • Abuse: safe (minimal) - 0.294
   • Escalation: safe (minimal) - 0.000
   • Crisis: safe (minimal) - 0.000
   • Content Filter: blocked (critical) - 0.800

⚠️  INTERVENTIONS:
   - [CRITICAL] Contact emergency services or crisis intervention team
   - [CRITICAL] Block content and prevent further interaction

💡 ANALYSIS:
   Any profanity directed at children triggers immediate intervention with emergency escalation and content blocking.

🔑 KEY POINTS:
   • Child-specific thresholds
   • Emergency intervention
   • Content blocking

✅ SUCCESS: Risk assessment matches expectation (critical)

📋 SCENARIO 2: Crisis Intervention - Self-Harm Detection
📝 Description: Shows how the system detects severe emotional distress and potential self-harm
--------------------------------------------------
📥 INPUT:
   Text: 'I want to kill myself and end this pain'
   Age Group: adult
   User ID: demo_user
   Session ID: demo_session

📤 OUTPUT:
   Overall Risk: CRITICAL
   Intervention Level: emergency
   Max Score: 1.000
   Processing Time: 0.001s

📊 MODEL BREAKDOWN:
   • Abuse: abusive (high) - 0.700
   • Escalation: safe (minimal) - 0.000
   • Crisis: critical_crisis (critical) - 1.000
   • Content Filter: allowed (minimal) - 0.000

⚠️  INTERVENTIONS:
   - [CRITICAL] Contact emergency services or crisis intervention team
   - [CRITICAL] Block content and prevent further interaction

💡 ANALYSIS:
   Direct self-harm indicators trigger immediate crisis intervention with emergency services contact.

🔑 KEY POINTS:
   • Crisis detection
   • Emergency escalation
   • Mental health resources

✅ SUCCESS: Risk assessment matches expectation (critical)

📋 SCENARIO 3: Safe Content - Normal Conversation
📝 Description: Demonstrates that normal, safe content is correctly identified
--------------------------------------------------
📥 INPUT:
   Text: 'Hello, how are you today? I hope you have a great day!'
   Age Group: child
   User ID: demo_user
   Session ID: demo_session

📤 OUTPUT:
   Overall Risk: MINIMAL
   Intervention Level: none
   Max Score: 0.002
   Processing Time: 0.001s

📊 MODEL BREAKDOWN:
   • Abuse: safe (minimal) - 0.002
   • Escalation: safe (minimal) - 0.000
   • Crisis: safe (minimal) - 0.000
   • Content Filter: allowed (minimal) - 0.000

💡 ANALYSIS:
   Normal, positive conversation is correctly identified as safe with no interventions needed.

🔑 KEY POINTS:
   • False positive prevention
   • Normal content handling
   • No unnecessary interventions

✅ SUCCESS: Risk assessment matches expectation (minimal)

⏸️  [PAUSE FOR VIDEO RECORDING]

📋 SCENARIO 4: Escalation Detection - Conversation Context
📝 Description: Shows how the system tracks conversation patterns for escalation
--------------------------------------------------
📥 INPUT:
   Text: 'I hate this conversation and you are making me angry!'
   Age Group: adult
   User ID: demo_user
   Session ID: demo_session

📤 OUTPUT:
   Overall Risk: HIGH
   Intervention Level: intervene
   Max Score: 0.582
   Processing Time: 0.001s

📊 MODEL BREAKDOWN:
   • Abuse: safe (minimal) - 0.372
   • Escalation: high_escalation (medium) - 0.582
   • Crisis: safe (minimal) - 0.000
   • Content Filter: allowed (minimal) - 0.000

⚠️  INTERVENTIONS:
   - [HIGH] Flag for immediate human moderator review
   - [HIGH] Show content warning before displaying

💡 ANALYSIS:
   Aggressive language with emotional intensity triggers escalation detection for human review.

🔑 KEY POINTS:
   • Conversation context
   • Emotional intensity
   • Human review trigger

⚠️  PARTIAL: Expected medium, got high

📋 SCENARIO 5: Adult Content Filtering - Age-Appropriate
📝 Description: Demonstrates age-appropriate content filtering for adults
--------------------------------------------------
📥 INPUT:
   Text: 'This movie contains violence and adult themes'
   Age Group: adult
   User ID: demo_user
   Session ID: demo_session

📤 OUTPUT:
   Overall Risk: MINIMAL
   Intervention Level: none
   Max Score: 0.200
   Processing Time: 0.001s

📊 MODEL BREAKDOWN:
   • Abuse: safe (minimal) - 0.001
   • Escalation: safe (minimal) - 0.077
   • Crisis: safe (minimal) - 0.200
   • Content Filter: allowed (minimal) - 0.040

💡 ANALYSIS:
   Content that would be blocked for children is allowed for adults with appropriate warnings.
