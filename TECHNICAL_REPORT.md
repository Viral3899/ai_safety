# AI Safety Models Proof of Concept - Technical Report

## Executive Summary

This technical report presents a comprehensive AI Safety Models Proof of Concept (POC) designed to enhance user safety in conversational AI platforms. The system implements four core safety models: Abuse Language Detection, Escalation Pattern Recognition, Crisis Intervention, and Content Filtering, integrated into a cohesive real-time processing pipeline.

## 1. High-Level Design Decisions

### 1.1 Architecture Philosophy
- **Modular Design**: Each safety model operates independently but integrates through a central SafetyManager
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized for sub-second inference times to support live conversations
- **Rule-based Foundation**: Hybrid approach combining rule-based logic with ML capabilities for reliability
- **Scalable Framework**: Designed to easily add new safety models or modify existing ones

### 1.2 Technology Stack Selection
- **Python**: Primary language for rapid prototyping and ML ecosystem integration
- **scikit-learn**: Core ML library for traditional classification tasks
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: For advanced NLP capabilities when needed
- **FastAPI**: Web framework for API development and real-time interfaces
- **Rule-based Logic**: Fallback and primary detection for critical safety scenarios

### 1.3 Safety-First Approach
- **Conservative Thresholds**: Lower thresholds for higher sensitivity in safety-critical scenarios
- **Multi-model Consensus**: Multiple models must agree for high-risk classifications
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Critical decisions trigger human review workflows
- **Bias Mitigation**: Built-in fairness evaluation and bias detection

## 2. Data Sources and Preprocessing Steps

### 2.1 Current Data Sources
**Synthetic Data Generation** (Current Implementation):
- **Abuse Detection**: 5,000 samples with safe, mild abuse, and severe abuse categories
- **Crisis Detection**: 3,000 samples covering safe content, mild concern, and crisis indicators
- **Content Filtering**: 4,000 samples with age-appropriate content classification
- **Escalation Detection**: 30 conversation sequences with normal and escalating patterns

### 2.2 Recommended Real Data Sources (Kaggle)
**Primary Datasets**:
1. **Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge**
   - 159,571 labeled comments for abuse detection
   - Multi-label classification (toxic, severe_toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity_hate)
   - Real-world social media data

2. **Suicide and Depression Detection**
   - Reddit posts with mental health labels
   - Crisis intervention training data
   - Emotional distress indicators

3. **Common Crawl News Comments**
   - Large-scale comment dataset
   - Diverse language patterns
   - Real user-generated content

### 2.3 Preprocessing Pipeline
```python
def preprocess_text(text):
    # 1. Normalization
    text = text.lower().strip()
    
    # 2. Internet slang handling
    replacements = {'u': 'you', 'ur': 'your', '2': 'to', '4': 'for'}
    
    # 3. Feature extraction
    features = extract_linguistic_features(text)
    
    # 4. Age-appropriate filtering
    content_scores = calculate_age_specific_scores(features, age_group)
    
    return processed_text, features
```

### 2.4 Data Augmentation Strategy
- **Synonym Replacement**: Replace profanity with similar intensity words
- **Context Variation**: Generate different conversational contexts
- **Age Group Adaptation**: Modify content appropriateness for different age groups
- **Bias Balancing**: Ensure representation across demographic groups

        # 2. Conversation trend analysis
        negative_trend = analyze_negative_trend(conversation_history)
        topic_persistence = analyze_topic_persistence(conversation_history)
        intensity_trend = analyze_intensity_trend(conversation_history)
        
        # 3. Composite escalation score
        escalation_score = (
            current_intensity * 0.4 +
            negative_trend * 0.3 +
            topic_persistence * 0.2 +

            r'\b(can.*t.*go.*on|want.*to.*die)\b',
            r'\b(nothing.*left.*to.*live)\b'
        ]
        
    def detect_crisis(self, text):
        crisis_score = 0.0
        
        # 1. Direct threat detection
        for pattern in self.crisis_patterns:
            if re.search(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE):
                crisis_score += 0.8
                
        # 2. Emotional distress indicators
        distress_words = ['hopeless', 'worthless', 'burden', 'better off dead']
        for word in distress_words:
            if word in text.lower():
                crisis_score += 0.3
                
        return min(crisis_score, 1.0)

            'child': {'profanity': 0.0, 'violence': 0.1, 'sexual': 0.0},
            'teen': {'profanity': 0.2, 'violence': 0.3, 'sexual': 0.1},
            'adult': {'profanity': 0.8, 'violence': 1.0, 'sexual': 0.8}
